It seems like you've fixed a lot of ZGI bugs. Do all your changes make the DVD version of the game playable? If so, would you mind terribly compiling it?

I would really like to share it on the GOG forums for the game. GOG reports that they updated the game to the DVD version, but of course it didn't actually work because of ScummVM compatibility issues.

Would really like to hear from you, my email is here: https://pastebin.com/X5vTECCh
